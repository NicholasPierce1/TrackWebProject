                <p id="homePageTrackAndYouQuestion">What's so special about track?</p>
                <p id="homePageTrackAndYouAnswer"><span id="firstSentenceOfAnswer">The short answer is you!</span> Anyone and everyone, regardless of age, status, and location 
                can participate in track and field! Running is an unverisal sport- which means it requires very little to no prior training or equipment. Just put on a pair of tennis shoes and go to a track near you! Local track competitions and running groups are hosted in multiple local areas all the time! The better question to ask is what are you waiting for? </p>
